<P>The aim of my BTP project at IIT Delhi was to create artistic representation of videos.
 What you see in the left is one of the final results of this project and in my opinion
 closest I could get in realising this aim. This result was produced by collective application
  of several pre-existing techniques of NPR and few tweaks of my own. I would explain each of
  them in detail as we proceed.</p>

<P>One of the more obvious steps in video NPR(Non Photo realistic Rendering) is to extract frames from it
 and apply artistic rendering on each of frames separately. In fact image NPR can be considered sub problem of
 video NPR(why?). So I dedicated a considerable amount of time learning pre-existing techniques and thinking about
 new ones to do this job. One of simplest methods of image NPR is to apply a collection of filters on an image.
  For example <a href ="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/course/dip/demos/quatiexample.html"> Quantization</a>
  , <a href="http://www.lutanho.net/pic2html/index.html">Halftoning </a>.

When I researched I found that today NPR is such a big field that a separate international
 <a href = "http://www.npar.org/">conference</a> is held for it. One of the biggest breakthroughs
 of image NPR were published by Paul Haeberli in his paper <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=97902">
  Paint By Numbers: Abstract Image Representations</a>. In this paper the main concept was to represent
  a painting as an ordered collection of brush strokes.<img src="img/lily_pad_lotus_flowerresult.png" height="40%" align=right>
<DIV STYLE="{position: absolute; right: 10;height: 300;z-index:1;}">
<img src="img/lily_pad_lotus_flower.jpg"/ alt="Image used as input" height="30%" align="right">
</DIV>

  Each stroke has 5 parameters
<ul>
<li>Location
<li>Position - of the brush stroke.
<li>Color - The RGB and alpha values.
<li>Size - How big the stroke is.
<li>Direction Angle of the stroke painting.
<li>Shape The look of the brush stroke.
</ul>
Out of these color can be decided automatically as an average color of all pixels around the center of the stroke or
the color of the pixel at the stroke center. But manual specification of the rest of parameters can be tedious
especially when large no of images have to processed.
